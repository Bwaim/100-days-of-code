# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goals: Apply MVVM architecture with Architecture component on my second Android Project of ABND track - ScoreKeeper

### Day 0: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Creation of the new branch. Updating projects. Start to refactor.

**Thoughts:** I don't know exactly how to implement MVVM, so i searched some sources with examples.

### Day 1: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring layer data. Create the test of the repository

**Thoughts:** I understand the principle of the repository, using and interface with callback to pass data to the ViewModel.
