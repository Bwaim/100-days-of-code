# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goals: Apply MVVM architecture with Architecture component on my second Android Project of ABND track - ScoreKeeper

### Day 0: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Creation of the new branch. Updating projects. Start to refactor.

**Thoughts:** I don't know exactly how to implement MVVM, so i searched some sources with examples.

**Link to work:** [ScoreKeeper App](https://github.com/Bwaim/ScoreKeeper)
